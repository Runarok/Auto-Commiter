# Auto-Committer

<h6><strong>Is the Update Time Workflow Working</strong></h6> 

[![Runarok Update Time](https://github.com/Runarok/Auto-Commiter/workflows/update-time/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Runarok/Auto-Commiter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22update-time%22)

I created this project out of curiosity after seeing the first repo reach 3 million commits: [Commited by virejdasani](https://github.com/virejdasani/Commited).

Instead of spamming commits, I decided to create a version that updates the commit log every hour. It updates both the military time and normal time in a file named `time.json`.
