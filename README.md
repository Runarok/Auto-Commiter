# Auto-Committer

I created this project out of curiosity after seeing the first repo reach 3 million commits: [Commited by virejdasani](https://github.com/virejdasani/Commited).

Instead of spamming commits, I decided to create a version that updates the commit log every hour. It updates both the military time and normal time in a file named `time.json`.
