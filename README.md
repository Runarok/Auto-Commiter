# Auto-Committer

<h6><strong>Is the Update Time Workflow Working</strong></h6> 

[![Runarok Update Time](https://github.com/Runarok/Auto-Commiter/workflows/update-time/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Runarok/Auto-Commiter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22update-time%22)

I created this project out of curiosity after seeing the most [Commited repo](https://github.com/virejdasani/Commited), which hit 3 million commits.

Instead of spamming commits, I decided to create a version that updates the commit log every 30 minutes. It updates the date, along with both military time and normal time, in a file named `time.json`.

**Note:** The update might not be exactly at UTC :00 and :30 due to server load.

> Finalized the YAML/action as of 12th February 2025. Proper auto-updating started as of 3:00 PM UTC.
